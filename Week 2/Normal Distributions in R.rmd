Intelligence IQ scores follow normal 
normal distribution with mean Mu = 100
standard deviation (sigma) is 15
Let X be a random variable for the score after randomly selecitng

$$
  X \sim N(\mu = 100, \sigma^ 2 = 15^2)
$$
```{r}

##plot_norm_prob(mu = 100, sigma = 15, lower = 100, upper = 100)
```

Probably a person has an IQ less than 115

```{r}
pnorm(115, 100, 15)
```

$$
Z = \frac{X -\mu}{\sigma} \sim N(0,1)
$$
