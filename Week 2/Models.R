#y - stopping distance, response, target, outcome
#x - speed, predictor

#develop a model for this prediction
#Y = f(x) + error
#Y = signal + noise, explained plus unexplained
#what do you use for f(x)?
#you could use a constant value
#underfitting - only summarizes Y using Y
#a wild polynomial - overfitting

#linear model, the signal will be
#f(x) = Bo + B1x (Bo intercept, B1 slope)
